## Development

### Pre-commit hook

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automate code format and so on as much as possible. If you're interested in the development of ScalarDB, please [install pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) and the git hook script as follows.

```
$ ls -a .pre-commit-config.yaml
.pre-commit-config.yaml
$ pre-commit install
```

The code formatter is automatically executed when committing files. A commit will fail and be formatted by the formatter when any invalid code format is detected. Try to commit the change again.
