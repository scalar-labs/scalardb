[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/scalar-labs/scalardb/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=672f70ce7f2c4f8d9e71f7c9db8ae824e2cfaeca)](https://circleci.com/gh/scalar-labs/scalardb/tree/master)

A library that makes non-ACID distributed databases/storages ACID-compliant. It not only supports strongly-consistent ACID transactions, but also scales linearly and achieves high availability when it is deployed with distributed databases/storages such as Cassandra.

## Install
The library is available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:scalardb). You can install it in your application using your build tool such as Gradle. For example in Gradle, you can add the following dependency to your build.gradle.

```
dependencies {
    compile group: 'com.scalar-labs', name: 'scalardb', version: '1.0.0'
}
```
