## Scalar DB

[![CI](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/scalar-labs/scalardb/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

Scalar DB is a universal transaction manager that achieves:
- database/storage-agnostic ACID transactions in a scalable manner even if an underlying database or storage is not ACID-compliant.
- multi-storage/database/service ACID transactions that can span multiple (possibly different) databases, storages, and services.

## Install
The library is available on [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:scalardb). 
You can install it in your application using your build tool such as Gradle and Maven. 

To add a dependency on Scalar DB using Gradle, use the following:
```gradle
