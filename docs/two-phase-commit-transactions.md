# Two-phase Commit Transactions

ScalarDB also supports two-phase commit style transactions called *Two-phase Commit Transactions*.
With Two-phase Commit Transactions, you can execute a transaction that spans multiple processes/applications (e.g., Microservices).

This document briefly explains how to execute Two-phase Commit Transactions in ScalarDB.

## Configuration

The configuration for Two-phase Commit Transactions is the same as the one for the normal transaction.

For example, you can set the following configuration when you use Cassandra:

```properties
# Comma separated contact points
scalar.db.contact_points=cassandra

# Port number for all the contact points. Default port number for each database is used if empty.
scalar.db.contact_port=9042

# Credential information to access the database
scalar.db.username=cassandra
scalar.db.password=cassandra

# Storage implementation. Either cassandra or cosmos or dynamo or jdbc can be set. Default storage is cassandra.
scalar.db.storage=cassandra
```

Please see [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for configurations of other databases/storages.

### ScalarDB Server

You can also execute Two-phase Commit Transactions through the ScalarDB Server.
You don't need a special configuration for Two-phase Commit Transactions, so you can follow [the ScalarDB Server document](scalardb-server.md) to use it.

## How to execute Two-phase Commit Transactions

This section explains how to execute Two-phase Commit Transactions.

Like a well-known two-phase commit protocol, there are two roles, a coordinator and a participant, that collaboratively execute a single transaction.
The coordinator process first begins a transaction, and the participant processes join the transaction.

### Get a TwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager instance

First, you need to get a `TwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager` instance to execute Two-phase Commit Transactions.
You can use `TransactionFactory` to get a `TwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager` instance as follows:
```java
TransactionFactory factory = TransactionFactory.create("<configuration file path>");
TwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager transactionManager = factory.getTwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager();
```

### Begin/Start a transaction (for coordinator)

You can begin/start a transaction as follows:
```java
// Begin a transaction
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.begin();

Or

// Start a transaction
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.start();
```

The process/application that begins the transaction acts as a coordinator, as mentioned.

You can also begin/start a transaction by specifying a transaction ID as follows:
```java
// Begin a transaction with specifying a transaction ID
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.begin("<transaction ID>");

Or

// Start a transaction with specifying a transaction ID
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.start("<transaction ID>");
```

Note that you must guarantee uniqueness of the transaction ID in this case.

And, you can get the transaction ID with `getId()` as follows:
```java
tx.getId();
```

### Join the transaction (for participants)

If you are a participant, you can join the transaction that has been begun by the coordinator as follows:
```java
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.join("<transaction ID>")
```

You need to specify the transaction ID associated with the transaction that the coordinator has begun.

### CRUD operations for the transaction

The CRUD operations of `TwoPhaseCommitTransacton` are the same as the ones of `DistributedTransaction`.
So please see also [Java API Guide - CRUD operations](api-guide.md#crud-operations) for the details.

This is an example code for CRUD operations in Two-phase Commit Transactions:
```java
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = ...

// Retrieve the current balances for ids
Get fromGet =
    Get.newBuilder()
        .namespace(NAMESPACE)
        .table(TABLE)
        .partitionKey(new Key(ID, fromId))
        .build();

Get toGet =
    Get.newBuilder()
        .namespace(NAMESPACE)
        .table(TABLE)
        .partitionKey(new Key(ID, toId))
        .build();

Optional<Result> fromResult = tx.get(fromGet);
Optional<Result> toResult = tx.get(toGet);

// Calculate the balances (it assumes that both accounts exist)
int newFromBalance = fromResult.get().getInt(BALANCE) - amount;
int newToBalance = toResult.get().getInt(BALANCE) + amount;

// Update the balances
Put fromPut =
    Put.newBuilder()
        .namespace(NAMESPACE)
        .table(TABLE)
        .partitionKey(new Key(ID, fromId))
        .intValue(BALANCE, newFromBalance)
        .build();

Put toPut =
    Put.newBuilder()
        .namespace(NAMESPACE)
        .table(TABLE)
        .partitionKey(new Key(ID, toId))
        .intValue(BALANCE, newToBalance)
        .build();

tx.put(fromPut);
tx.put(toPut);
```

### Prepare/Commit/Rollback the transaction

After finishing CRUD operations, you need to commit the transaction.
Like a well-known two-phase commit protocol, there are two phases: prepare and commit phases.
You first need to prepare the transaction in all the coordinator/participant processes, and then you need to commit the transaction in all the coordinator/participant processes as follows:
```java
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = ...

try {
  // Execute CRUD operations in the coordinator/participant processes
  ...

  // Prepare phase: Prepare the transaction in all the coordinator/participant processes
  tx.prepare();
  ...

  // Commit phase: Commit the transaction in all the coordinator/participant processes
  tx.commit();
  ...
} catch (TransactionException e) {
  // When an error happans, you need to rollback the transaction in all the coordinator/participant processes
  tx.rollback();
  ...
}
```

If an error happens, you need to call `rollback()` (or `abort()`) in all the coordinator/participant processes.

You can call `prepare()`, `commit()`, `rollback()` in the coordinator/participant processes in parallel for better performance.

#### Validate the transaction

Depending on the concurrency control protocol, you need to call `validate()` in all the coordinator/participant processes after `prepare()` and before `commit()`:
```java
// Prepare phase 1: Prepare the transaction in all the coordinator/participant processes
tx.prepare();
...

// Prepare phase 2: Validate the transaction in all the coordinator/participant processes
tx.validate();
...

// Commit phase: Commit the transaction in all the coordinator/participant processes
tx.commit();
...
```

Similar to `prepare()`, you can call `validate()` in the coordinator/participant processes in parallel for better performance.

Currently, you need to call `validate()` when you use the `Consensus Commit` transaction manager with `EXTRA_READ` serializable strategy in `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level.
In other cases, `validate()` does nothing.

### Handle Exceptions

Let's look at the following example code to see how to handle exceptions in Two-phase commit transactions.

```java
public class Sample {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
    TransactionFactory factory = TransactionFactory.create("<configuration file path>");
    TwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager transactionManager =
        factory.getTwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager();

    int retryCount = 0;

    while (true) {
      if (retryCount++ > 0) {
        // Retry the transaction three times maximum in this sample code
        if (retryCount >= 3) {
          return;
        }
        // Sleep 100 milliseconds before retrying the transaction in this sample code
        TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS.sleep(100);
      }

      // Begin a transaction
      TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx;
      try {
        tx = transactionManager.begin();
      } catch (TransactionNotFoundException e) {
        // if the transaction fails to begin due to transient faults. You can retry the transaction
        continue;
      } catch (TransactionException e) {
        // If beginning a transaction failed, it indicates some failure happens during the
        // transaction, so you should cancel the transaction or retry the transaction after the
        // failure or error is fixed
        return;
      }

      try {
        // Execute CRUD operations in the transaction
        Optional<Result> result = tx.get(...);
        List<Result> results = tx.scan(...);
        tx.put(...);
        tx.delete(...);

        // Prepare the transaction
        tx.prepare();

        // validate the transaction
        tx.validate();

        // Commit the transaction
        tx.commit();
      } catch (CrudConflictException
          | PreparationConflictException
          | ValidationConflictException
          | CommitConflictException e) {
        // If you catch CrudConflictException or PreparationConflictException or
        // ValidationConflictException or CommitConflictException, it indicates a transaction
        // conflict occurs during the transaction, so you can retry the transaction from the
        // beginning
        try {
          tx.rollback();
        } catch (RollbackException ex) {
          // Rolling back the transaction failed. You can log it here
        }
      } catch (CrudException | PreparationException | ValidationException | CommitException e) {
        // If you catch CrudException or PreparationException or ValidationException or
        // CommitException, it indicates some failure happens, so you should cancel the transaction
        // or retry the transaction after the failure or error is fixed
        try {
          tx.rollback();
        } catch (RollbackException ex) {
          // Rolling back the transaction failed. You can log it here
        }
        return;
      } catch (UnknownTransactionStatusException e) {
        // If you catch `UnknownTransactionStatusException` when committing the transaction, you are
        // not sure if the transaction succeeds or not. In such a case, you need to check if the
        // transaction is committed successfully or not and retry it if it failed. How to identify a
        // transaction status is delegated to users
        return;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `begin()` API could throw `TransactionException` and `TransactionNotFoundException`.
If you catch `TransactionException`, it indicates some failure (e.g., database failure and network error) happens during the transaction, so you should cancel the transaction or retry the transaction after the failure or error is fixed.
If you catch `TransactionNotFoundException`, it indicates the transaction fails to begin due to transient faults. You can retry the transaction. So you can retry the transaction in this case.

Although not illustrated in the sample code, the `join()` API could also throw a `TransactionException` and `TransactionNotFoundException`.
And the way to handle them is the same as the `begin()` API.

The APIs for CRUD operations (`get()`/`scan()`/`put()`/`delete()`/`mutate()`) could throw `CrudException` and `CrudConflictException`.
If you catch `CrudException`, it indicates some failure (e.g., database failure and network error) happens during the transaction, so you should cancel the transaction or retry the transaction after the failure or error is fixed.
If you catch `CrudConflictException`, it indicates a transaction conflict occurs during the transaction so you can retry the transaction from the beginning, preferably with well-adjusted exponential backoff based on your application and environment.
The sample code retries three times maximum and sleeps 100 milliseconds before retrying the transaction.

The `prepare()` API could throw `PreparationException` and `PreparationConflictException`.
If you catch `PreparationException`, like the `CrudException` case, you should cancel the transaction or retry the transaction after the failure or error is fixed.
If you catch `PreparationConflictException`, like the `CrudConflictException` case, you can retry the transaction from the beginning.

The `validate()` API could throw `ValidationException` and `ValidationConflictException`.
If you catch `ValidationException`, like the `CrudException` case, you should cancel the transaction or retry the transaction after the failure or error is fixed.
If you catch `ValidationConflictException`, like the `CrudConflictException` case, you can retry the transaction from the beginning.

The `commit()` API could throw `CommitException`, `CommitConflictException`, and `UnknownTransactionStatusException`.
If you catch `CommitException`, like the `CrudException` case, you should cancel the transaction or retry the transaction after the failure or error is fixed.
If you catch `CommitConflictException`, like the `CrudConflictException` case, you can retry the transaction from the beginning.
If you catch `UnknownTransactionStatusException`, you are not sure if the transaction succeeds or not.
In such a case, you need to check if the transaction is committed successfully or not and retry it if it fails.
How to identify a transaction status is delegated to users.
You may want to create a transaction status table and update it transactionally with other application data so that you can get the status of a transaction from the status table.

Please note that if you begin a transaction by specifying a transaction ID, you must use a different ID when you retry the transaction.

Although not illustrated in the sample code, the `resume()` API could also throw a `TransactionNotFoundException`.
This exception indicates that the transaction associated with the specified ID was not found, and it might have been expired.
In such cases, you can retry the transaction from the beginning.

### Request Routing in Two-phase Commit Transactions

Services using Two-phase Commit Transactions usually execute a transaction by exchanging multiple requests and responses as follows:

![](images/two_phase_commit_sequence_diagram.png)

Also, each service typically has multiple servers (or hosts) for scalability and availability and uses server-side (proxy) or client-side load balancing to distribute requests to the servers.
In such a case, since a transaction processing in Two-phase Commit Transactions is stateful, requests in a transaction must be routed to the same servers while different transactions need to be distributed to balance the load.

![](images/two_phase_commit_load_balancing.png)

There are several approaches to achieve it depending on the protocol between the services. Here, we introduce some approaches for gRPC and HTTP/1.1.

#### gPRC

Please see [this document](https://grpc.io/blog/grpc-load-balancing/) for the details of gRPC Load Balancing.

When you use a client-side load balancer, you can use the same gRPC connection to send requests in a transaction, which guarantees that the requests go to the same servers.

When you use a server-side (proxy) load balancer, solutions are different between when using L3/L4 (transport level) and L7 (application level) load balancer.
When using an L3/L4 load balancer, you can use the same gRPC connection to send requests in a transaction, similar to when you use a client-side load balancer.
Requests in the same gRPC connection always go to the same server in L3/L4 load balancing.
When using an L7 load balancer, since requests in the same gRPC connection do not necessarily go to the same server, you need to use cookies or similar for routing requests to correct server.
For example, when you use [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/), you can use session affinity (sticky session) for gRPC.
Or you can also use [Bidirectional streaming RPC in gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/what-is-grpc/core-concepts/#bidirectional-streaming-rpc) since the L7 load balancer distributes requests in the same stream to the same server.

#### HTTP/1.1

Typically, you use a server-side (proxy) load balancer with HTTP/1.1.
When using an L3/L4 load balancer, you can use the same HTTP connection to send requests in a transaction, which guarantees the requests go to the same server.
When using an L7 load balancer, since requests in the same HTTP connection do not necessarily go to the same server, you need to use cookies or similar for routing requests to correct server.
You can use session affinity (sticky session) in that case.

#### Resume a transaction

Since services using Two-phase Commit Transactions exchange multiple requests/responses, you may need to execute a transaction across multiple endpoints/APIs.
For such cases, you can resume a transaction object (a `TwoPhaseCommitTransaction` instance) that you began or joined as follows:

```java
// Join (or begin) the transaction
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.join("<transaction ID>");

...

// Resume the transaction by the trnasaction ID
TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx1 = transactionManager.resume("<transaction ID>")
```

For example, let's say you have two services that have the following endpoints:

```java
interface ServiceA {
  void facadeEndpoint() throws Exception;
}

interface ServiceB {
  void endpoint1(String txId) throws Exception;

  void endpoint2(String txId) throws Exception;

  void prepare(String txId) throws Exception;

  void commit(String txId) throws Exception;

  void rollback(String txId) throws Exception;
}
```

And, let's say a client calls `ServiceA.facadeEndpoint()` that begins a transaction that spans the two services (`ServiceA` and `ServiceB`) as follows:

```java
public class ServiceAImpl implements ServiceA {

  private TwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager transactionManager = ...;
  private ServiceB serviceB = ...;

  ...

  @Override
  public void facadeEndpoint() throws Exception {
    TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.begin();

    try {
      ...

      // Call ServiceB endpoint1
      serviceB.endpoint1(tx.getId());

      ...

      // Call ServiceB endpoint2
      serviceB.endpoint2(tx.getId());

      ...

      // Prepare
      tx.prepare();
      serviceB.prepare(tx.getId());

      // Commit
      tx.commit();
      serviceB.commit(tx.getId());
    } catch (Exception e) {
      // Rollback
      tx.rollback();
      serviceB.rollback(tx.getId());
    }
  }
}
```

This facade endpoint in `ServiceA` calls multiple endpoints (`endpoint1()`, `endpoint2()`, `prepare()`, `commit()`, and `rollback()`) of `ServiceB`.
And in Two-phase Commit Transactions, you need to use the same transaction object across the endpoints.
For this situation, you can resume the transaction.
The implementation of `ServiceB` is as follows:

```java
public class ServiceBImpl implements ServiceB {

  private TwoPhaseCommitTransactionManager transactionManager = ...;

  ...

  @Override
  public void endpoint1(String txId) throws Exception {
    // First, you need to join the transaction
    TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.join(txId);
  }

  @Override
  public void endpoint2(String txId) throws Exception {
    // You can resume the transaction that you joined in endpoint1()
    TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.resume(txId);
  }

  @Override
  public void prepare(String txId) throws Exception {
    // You can resume the transaction
    TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.resume(txId);

    ...

    // Prepare
    tx.prepare();
  }

  @Override
  public void commit(String txId) throws Exception {
    // You can resume the transaction
    TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.resume(txId);

    ...

    // Commit
    tx.commit();
  }

  @Override
  public void rollback(String txId) throws Exception {
    // You can resume the transaction
    TwoPhaseCommitTransaction tx = transactionManager.resume(txId);

    ...

    // Rollback
    tx.rollback();
  }
}
```

As you can see, by resuming the transaction, you can share the same transaction object across multiple endpoints in `ServiceB`.
